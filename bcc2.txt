Recommendation on how to redeem Bitcoin Cash
============================================

July 31st, 2017.

ElectrumSys is a Syscoin wallet created by Thomas Voegtlin in 2011.
ElectrumSys is distributed by ElectrumSys Technologies GmbH, a company
registered in Germany, using the website https://electrum.syscoin.org

Users who want to run the Electron Cash binaries should do
it on a separate machine, that does not have their Syscoin wallet. We
recommend to proceed as follows:

 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your
 ElectrumSys wallets.

 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks
 have been mined.

 3. Move all your ElectrumSys funds to a new ElectrumSys wallet. This will
 move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has
 replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.

 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in
 Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet,
 entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds
 at risk.

Following these 4 easy steps you will be able to access your BCC
without compromising your BTC.
